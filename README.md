I'm Paweł Czyż, a doctoral fellow at the [ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch/) aiming to develop computational tools that can advance personalised medicine and our understanding of cancer. I use techniques from probabilistic machine learning, deep generative modelling, Bayesian statistics, and computational geometry.
