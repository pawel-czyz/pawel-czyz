I'm Paweł Czyż, a doctoral fellow at the [ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch/).

I am a [toolsmith](https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2022/toolsmith/) aiming to develop solutions that can advance personalised medicine and our understanding of cancer.

I use techniques from probabilistic machine learning, deep generative modelling, Bayesian statistics, and computational geometry.
