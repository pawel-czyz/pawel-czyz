I'm a [doctoral fellow](https://ai.ethz.ch/about-us/people/pawel-czyz.html) at the [ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch/), aiming to develop computational tools that can advance personalised medicine and our understanding of cancer.

I am generally interested in:
  - probabilistic machine learning,
  - Bayesian statistics,
  - computational geometry,
  - cancer genomics and transcriptomics.
